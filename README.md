# DeFi Staking
This project was created by following along with the DeFi Staking App workshop from Chainlink's 2022 Spring Hackathon. The video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-48_hdo9_gg

In the workshop, HardHat was used for tests. This repo replaces the deployment and testing capabilities described in the workshop with Brownie.
